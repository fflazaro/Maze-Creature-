Do you have test functions testing all your functions?
I think I tested all of the functions. I didn't test every single method of the maze/creature class. I 
tested the classes based on whether the creature would properly solve the maze or not. 

complete and correct programs:  40/ 50


Does your program compile without warnings? Are there any blocks of
repeated code that can be simplified?
The program didn't compile without warnings; I didn't use some of the methods though even though my creature
can still solve the maze. I think some repeated code could be simplified, but Clion would not let me 
properly fix the functions in the main section. 

good programming practices:   25  / 30

Do you have comments for each class both in the header and
implementation file? Does each variable and function have an
associated comment? Is your program properly indented? See "Code Style
Examples - Snippets" under C++ Resources for some common problems. For
example, all file names have to be in lowercase, all class names are
capitalized, need to have spaces after comments, stick to maximum 80
characters per line, space between operators, etc.



code that is easy to understand:     15/ 20
